= Quarkus - Zookeeper
:extension-status: dev

Stateful client to Apache Zookeeper (https://zookeeper.apache.org/).

ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

== Installation

If you want to use this extension, you need to add the `io.quarkiverse.quarkus-zookeeper:quarkus-zookeeper` extension first.
In your `pom.xml` file, add:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.quarkus-zookeeper</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-zookeeper</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

This extension produces an application scoped bean for the ZooKeeper client, which can be directly injected into a managed bean:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class ZookeeperService implements AsyncObserverExceptionHandler {
    
    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(ZookeeperService.class);
    
    @Inject ZooKeeper client;
    
    public void onZKEvent(@ObservesAsync WatchedEvent event) {
        LOG.infof("Receiving [%s]", event.getState());
    }
}
----

As shown by the example, it also provides a binding between ZooKeeper watched events and an asynch CDI bus.
